# amber-gfx-shader-lab

`amber-gfx-shader-lab` explores graphics in Dart. The repository keeps the core rule set compact, then surrounds it with examples that show how the decisions move.

## Amber Gfx Shader Lab Notes

The quickest review path is the verifier first, then the fixtures, then the operations note. That order makes it easy to see whether the code, data, and explanation still agree.

## Feature Notes

- Includes extended examples for render inputs, including `surge` and `degraded`.
- Documents stable output tradeoffs in `docs/operations.md`.
- Runs locally with a single verification command and no external credentials.
- Stores project constants and verification metadata in `metadata/project.json`.
- Adds a repository audit script that checks structure before running the language verifier.

## Why This Exists

I use this kind of project to make a rule visible before adding more machinery around it. The important part here is not the size of the codebase. It is that the input signals, scoring rule, fixture data, and expected output can all be checked in one sitting.

## Code Tour

- `lib`: library code
- `tests`: verification harness
- `fixtures`: compact golden scenarios
- `examples`: expanded scenario set
- `metadata`: project constants and verification metadata
- `docs`: operations and extension notes
- `scripts`: local verification and audit commands

## Implementation Notes

The core is a scoring model over demand, capacity, latency, risk, and weight. That keeps geometry data, layout fixtures, and render inputs in one explicit decision path. The threshold is 178, with risk penalty 4, latency penalty 2, and weight bonus 3. The Dart project uses a small library and assertion script, avoiding package dependencies for verification.

## Try It

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/verify.ps1
```

This runs the language-level build or test path against the compact fixture set.

## Example Scenarios

`examples/extended_cases.csv` adds six named cases. I kept the names plain so failures are easy to read in a terminal: baseline, pressure, surge, degraded, recovery, and boundary.

## Tests

```powershell
powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts/audit.ps1
```

The audit command checks repository structure and README constraints before it delegates to the verifier.

## Boundaries

The scoring model is simple by design. More domain-specific behavior should be added through explicit adapters or extra fixture classes rather than hidden constants.

## Roadmap

- Add a short report command that prints the score breakdown for a single scenario.
- Add malformed input fixtures so the failure path is as visible as the happy path.
- Split the scoring constants into a typed configuration object and validate it before use.
- Add one more graphics fixture that focuses on a malformed or borderline input.

## Local Setup

Use a normal shell with Dart available on `PATH`. The verifier is written as a PowerShell script because the portfolio was assembled on Windows.
